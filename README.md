🔐 Password Manager – MERN Stack Project
Description:

I developed a secure and user-friendly Password Manager web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and styled it with Tailwind CSS.
The application allows users to store, edit, and delete passwords efficiently. Each password entry includes:
Website URL
Username or Email
Password

Key Features:

🔒 Add New Credentials: Users can save login credentials for various websites.
📝 Edit Existing Entries: Easily update stored usernames, passwords, or associated notes.
❌ Delete Credentials: Remove outdated or unnecessary credentials.
📁 MongoDB Integration: All data is stored in a secure MongoDB database using a RESTful API built with Express.js and Node.js.
⚡ Responsive UI: Built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.

This project demonstrates CRUD operations, RESTful API integration, and full-stack development practices with a focus on user data security and frontend responsiveness.
